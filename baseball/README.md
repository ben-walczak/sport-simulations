# Simulation of Major League Baseball Games
The problem that I will be exploring is simulating a Major League Baseball game of two teams, given the batting statistics of their 9 best batters for the 2018 season. The two specific teams I will be looking at in particular are the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago Cubs. I will be pulling data of each batter from ESPN. There I will get data for each batter such as games played, at bat, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, runs batted in, total bases, walks, strike outs, stolen bases, batting average, on base percentage, slugging percentage, OPS. However, only a few of these variables will be incorporated such as times at bat, hits, walks, strikeouts, doubles, triples, and home runs. Each of these statistics can be used to calculate the probability of getting on base, walking, strike outs, etc. Future work can be done to use more complicated statistics. 

After successfully simulating one game, I will expand this to a series of games between two teams. Then, finally, I will expand this to simulate an entire season, where each team plays a few series against other teams in its division. The results of wins/losses over the course of a season should provide interesting insight into what teams could potentially lead the rankings.
